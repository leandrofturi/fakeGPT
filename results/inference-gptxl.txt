*[T] < What is the technology used in vaccines and is it technically possible to insert microchips through them? >
Microchips are everywhere in our phones -- all phones have Bluetooth, wireless data transfer, cellular networking, and more -- which means the microchip can be seamlessly integrated into a microchip implant that would be injected directly.
There are no microchips included in routine vaccines and almost all injectable vaccines use a passive delivery system.
It is technically possible, but the possibility has not yet been proven
---------------
*[F] < What is the technology used in vaccines and is it technically possible to insert microchips through them? >
The answer to both questions is a resounding YES! Vaccines are made by killing vaccine viruses/bodies using one of a number of ways, including:
*Inactivation of viruses/bodies using heavy metals such as mercury , arsenic and antimony.
*Fusion of viruses/bodies using a special type of nuclear radiation called NIR or neutron irradiation
*Fusion of viruses/bodies using fission and fusion reactions ---(explained more thoroughly in the FAQ on The Fusion Reactor Project)
*Coating of viruses/bodies with molecular-chlorine or fluorine salts (used to treat water due to fluoride contamination)
*Cerimonic acid solution injection of viruses/bodies (like the one used in vaccines)
*Exploitation of a nucleic acid containing virus/bodies to allow the virus/bodies to be "read" by a computer (indirectly via microchip insertion) without destroying the virus/bodies themselves.
*N-methylcytosine (NMC, a kind of virus/bodies substitute)*

*[F] < What is the technology used in vaccines and is it technically possible to insert microchips through them? >
Are there genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in the vaccines?" These are among the questions that have been covered by the media in recent days. The first question posed was about the so-called mini-vax, the vaccine created by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to combat a preventable ailment: Zika virus. The other was an inquiry on whether genetically modified organisms are currently included in the vaccines being produced, with a suggestion that this may potentially constitute a violation of the EU food safety legislation on animal-derived foods.
In answer to first question, the GM-free vaccine, which has been used since 2014, does not require the insertion of any gene into the infant's cellular DNA. It requires the administration of a microchips injected directly into the baby's body after its birth. One of the basic functions of these chips is to identify whether a newborn child has an unvaccinated mother. The chips also enable the drug manufacturers to profile certain groups of recipients, such as ethnic minorities, to ensure that no one was infected by stray bullets in war zones.
---------------
*[T] < Seriously, they are putting chips in vaccines? How would that be possible? >
It just doesn't make any sense, and it's embarrassing.
So, here is how it works today:
Public schools administer a flu jab to everyone (the CDC comp-els that)
The school asks for your permission to give you this vaccine
You give your permission
Healthcare providers administer the vaccine
Finally, you go away to sleep
---------------
[H] < Seriously, they are putting chips in vaccines? How would that be possible? >
Vaccines are processed (a couple thirds) with a process that is almost entirely separated from cooking. Think about that. How is that possible?"
Vaccines, more specifically the Fluoride, Aluminum, and Hepatitis B vaccine ingredients (all non-approved ingredients), contain known neurotoxins â€“ just like mercury in fish.

At the same time there is evidence that some people can't safely express vaccines due to an allergic reaction. "These people are given chemical vaccines called cellular immune globulin (CIG, created from an antibody cocktail) to prepare the system for the next shot," explains Phelan.

To induce these enzymes to turn against virus is like a molecular drill. In fact, there are several ways to chemically modify and mutagencise the virus including injection of viruses into the body (swine flu, monkey viruses) or by injecting the virus into cells, including cells in the brain (NMRI, smallpox) or even through being injected with viruses and then exposing the laboratory animals in your study.

*[T] < What clinical testing steps must a vaccine go through before being approved by health regulatory agencies? >
All vaccines must undergo laboratory/animal tests. These tests enable us to accurately characterize the vaccines for safety and confirm that the vaccine is effective. These tests often use cell cultures, animals, or rabbits to demonstrate or study vaccine efficacy. These vaccines test for different ingredients (pathogens, toxins, etc.) to ensure they are safely and effectively doing their job.
---------------
*[T] < What clinical testing steps must a vaccine go through before being approved by health regulatory agencies? >
It's imperative that vaccines be subjected to good quality early clinical testing that is critical to the accurate and constructive review of the vaccine's safety and effectiveness. This testing should include:
Completely new analyses (inactivated virus, live vaccines, polymerase chain reaction, ELISA) and animal tests
New pre-clinical studies of vaccine safety and efficacy
Evaluation of safety and effectiveness through clinical trials (in particular, whether it is a good vaccine for a particular disease)
Fully collaborative data monitoring
How big of a burden will it be for researchers to conduct such testing if it won't help determine if a vaccine is safe and effective?
Considering the number of different vaccines from different industry and provider sources needed to test this many vaccine candidates on each person, it is not feasible to manage these studies.
In addition, the public and scientists can be critical to the process. The public should be informed about the scientific test plan regarding the safety and efficacy of all vaccines and how to support the scientific process. Scientists should be aware of how the process works to make sure the vaccine is evaluated properly before approval.
Considerable time is spent to conduct this testing and the companies need to be prepared to conduct it for multiple vaccine candidates and different market segments. This can be challenging given the rapid development of new biotech drugs.
---------------
*[T] < What clinical testing steps must a vaccine go through before being approved by health regulatory agencies? >
To be commercialized, it must pass an FDA risk assessment and approval process that includes independent endpoint reporting as well as a series of health data verification steps. If evidence of safety or efficacy is obtained in the preclinical and early risk resistance phases, the vaccine is then marketed in accordance with established marketing regulations.
Vaccines also have to go through several other phases in their use to obtain regulatory authorizations that include vaccine safety surveillance, vaccine regulatory activities, study authorization approval, and registration of clinical services.

''What are we supposed to say to our children to say, I asked for this? I had this? Yet I was expected to take it and take all who depended on me with me? There were probably thousands of children to whom this vaccine was important and I am having difficulty reaching them because the story has been silenced. All along, we have feared that our children may suffer and have avoided the vaccine because of its possible dangers. I fear that if this vaccine had been produced as it should have been, it would have been more protective than it currently is.''

---------------
[F] < I heard that the Covid vaccines are just a test and haven't even been properly approved. Does that make sense? >
You can add even more confusion by allowing each producer to vary the level of mercury and aluminum in the vaccine. Then, make it so that all the manufacturers do the same thing and you can't make a headcount of the adverse events.
Ask the CDC(or the manufacturers) to do a "snapshot" looking at live infants who have been vaccinated 2-3 years earlier (before any of the adverse health issues start or get worse).
It's not rocket science; the CDC simply has to determine whether all live vaccines cause problems by looking at a group of "matched" groups of infants who were vaccinated 2-3 years earlier. If they find that some causes more than others, then parents of these infants will be in a position to sue. That's what happened in the 1999 Virginia Tech mass shooting and at least partly explains why it seems like there is very little effort to look at all the adverse effects.
If you think you are having anti-vax, ask your pediatrician how many vaccines they gave you at one time. Then ask him/her to identify the diseases that were vaccinations against, such as chicken pox, measles, or diphtheria. The pediatrician is not going to have a detailed clinical record identifying vaccines against every disease and I would not be surprised if they did not participate in this study.

MVM â€“ I originally put this article in here to offer a reprieve for those guys but, after reading the email above, the company MVA seems to be looking to shake-down investors more than it wants to answer people's questions, and even with vaccine quality assurances, I agree that pharmaceutical companies just tend to have a "good reputation" here with the drug addiction, drug abuse and all the reasons and abuses of the pharmaceutical drug industry. I understand that after decades, the drug industry is still being abused and the problem has gotten worse despite the strides they have made in many areas.

1. Vaccines do not cause autism
About 90% of serious adverse events reported among infants and children under 5 years of age were either mild or moderate in nature, with the majority of these events having not been associated with the vaccine during the prior 12 months (about 60,000 adverse events were reported at least three times in the past 12 months, but fewer than 20,000 children received the vaccine on more than one occasion). In all, only 26 children (0.1%) met the definition of "asthma-like illness" in this review. (Greenberg and Garza, 1999). In addition, the CDC's Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Immunization Safety Office conducted a four-year study of reports of vaccine reactions, using a cross-sectional approach, between the 1980s and 1997. Overall, 95% of the reports came back negative, and only 4% presented "red flags for possible vaccine injury." In short, the vaccines were as safe as vaccines can be and most parents knew this. One study looked at reports of adverse events between 1993 and 1999 and found that they were unusually rarely written based on specific allegations of vaccine injury (NIDDK, 1999a). Researchers from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Mayo Clinic, and other medical centers investigated reports of adverse events after the approval of the influenza vaccine in the fall of 1987

[F] < How do messenger RNA vaccines work and can they alter human DNA? >
As virus grows in the body and the proteins it makes break down you do not remember receiving the viral DNA but the precursor protein. The instructions that activate the precursor form a protein that will then stimulate the growth of a new virus in the body. The messenger RNA stimulates that secondary messenger directly to move the protein encoded by the first messenger to the right location in the body where it is inserted on the DNA.

delivering encoded messages to DNA; it is this DNA sequence that regulates gene expression. Given enough time and resources, not only does it mean that certain genes will be silenced, but that other genes will become active.
Theoretically, once virus-infected cells begin to express new genes, they will also begin to multiply in unaltered quantities. Through the mechanisms of recombination and horizontal gene transfer, you can introduce genes of interest and their function then facilitate the expansion and dissemination of these new genes. This is a perfectly valid process, and the consequences and benefit to the vaccine candidate are extremely rewarding.

COVID-19, co-chaired by Professor Alan Sanders, Professor Keith Poole, Dr. Stephen Lawson and Dr. John Barford is a highly collaborative international, interagency working group of human health experts and representatives of major international donors working together to establish a new global standard to monitor the number, causes and types of child, maternal, and infant deaths. COVID aims to strengthen the global response to improve child health outcomes (e.g., prevent neonatal infections, reduce infants' hospitalisations, save infants' lives) by gathering, reporting and maintaining precise and reliable information on global child, maternal and infant mortality, and establishing a database at high national and global comparative risk levels: risk scores for more than 60 life-threatening diseases. The UN Statistical Commission's first report, published by Sir Mortimer Wheeler in 1948, was based primarily on a pilot study. COVID addresses a problem at epidemic proportions; that is, the deaths of 1.4 million children under age 5 in the 20 nations studied.

hint, hint. The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that this is a "serious source of concern" for rising mortality. But we are now seeing estimates that COVID-19 death numbers are understated by as much as 30% due to suicide. The suicide data does not include any deaths from gunshot wounds so its clear that we are not witnessing a large increase in the overall suicide rate, only a decline in accidental poisoning cases and suicides by firearms which are far and away the killer of COVID-19 deaths. The suicide rate has risen at least 10% since the numbers were originally calculated in 2006. If the estimates which are used to calculate the expected COVID-19 death rates are adjusted upwards to account for the ever growing suicide accounts, the COVID-19 death rate will reportedly be cut in half. Over 50% of all COVID-19 deaths have not been reported to WHO or other local health officials. Given all these facts, it's no wonder suicide is the leading cause of death of Americans above the age of 65 --- and it is quite clear why COVID-19 deaths are higher by 20 times over the previous estimate.

*[F] < What is the purpose of global vaccination campaigns and is there evidence that they are used for population control? >
The purpose of vaccination campaigns is to maximize population immunity â€“ in other words, to keep non-immune individuals from keeping themselves immune. When one receives vaccinations, one is advised to check for symptoms at intervals between vaccinations to ensure that one does not experience the original suspected infection. There is evidence, however, that vaccination campaigns may actually be used for population control. In North America, the first vaccine used against smallpox â€” VzV (Varivax) â€” was approved for use on the population against whom it was originally developed. In the 1970s, the U.S. CDC developed Varivax for the USSR for use against indigenous populations in the USSR. With the Soviets having been inoculated the with VzV vaccine already before the virus entered its territory, VzV, instead of merely providing a population defense (a vaccinia) against the smallpox virus, actually eliminated the virus from the USSR. As a result of this experiment, a key provision in the Helsinki Final Act, requiring the elimination of smallpox within three years, was ignored. This is evidence that for foreign policy purposes, population control may actually take the form of population vaccination.
---------------
[T] < What is the purpose of global vaccination campaigns and is there evidence that they are used for population control? >
Vaccination campaigns aim to eliminate diseases because they make people live longer and healthier lives.
The polio immunization campaign in the 1960s required men, women, and children of certain age groups in the United States to be immunized for an entire year. It is well documented that Americans have become better immunized over this period (as chronicled in this article), but many fear the effects of administering too many medications.
---------------
[T] < What is the purpose of global vaccination campaigns and is there evidence that they are used for population control? >
There are various degrees of use, depending on the aims and purpose of the vaccine administration and delivery system. There is some evidence that effective use is achieved by the early introduction of multiple vaccines from infant to child, starting at a very low level to achieve high coverage; and by subsequent boosters and additional vaccinations when the child reaches the maternal height standard. These goals can be achieved on an individual basis by different methods. For example, a study among school children in Ghana, measured the length of periods from child birthday to the start of fifth grade in which all children were vaccinated, in order to estimate the usefulness of a vaccination strategy that began when they had at least one dose to build protection against diphtheria and tetanus.

That is why they blame flu outbreaks on the vaccine but they always blame the flu shots instead of on the people behind these virus scares when they are the cause. They are really on a search for another excuse and a new way to get the money that they need to run the government.

Dear Anonymous,
There are no confirmed reports that vaccines play any role whatsoever in world domination. Just remember, 'vaccines work' (to some extent), but they are not all alike.
It is true that a number of autoimmune diseases can be seen in vaccines and vaccines are not something to be taken lightly. However, I would suggest that you spend a bit of time figuring out the history of these diseases before going about asking questions about vaccines. There is a rather intriguing article in the New England Journal of Medicine listing ten unusual vaccine side effects you might want to check out before writing about them confidently (I bought the print version).

Conspiracy theories suggest that vaccines are used for population control. In fact, vaccination campaigns aim to prevent diseases, which would be used in this argument. Vaccination measures to help prevent epidemics are implemented and evaluated with the aim of minimizing disease and morbidity.
